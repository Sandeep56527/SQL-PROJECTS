/*
In this project, I have demonstrated essential data analysis skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
and solving business questions. The project involved identifying and correcting spelling errors, organizing data alphabetically, 
and addressing inconsistencies to ensure data quality. Through EDA, I uncovered insights and trends in the dataset, and I answered 
key business-related questions to support decision-making.
